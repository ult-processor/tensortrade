After countless hours of researching existing projects, spending endless nights watching PyData conference talks, and having many back-and-forth conversations with the hundreds of members of the  RL trading Discord community, I realized there weren't any existing solutions that were all that good.\n","\n","There were many bits and pieces of great reinforcement learning trading systems spread across the inter-webs, but nothing solid and complete. For this reason, I've decided to create an open source Python framework for getting any trading strategy from idea to production, efficiently, using deep reinforcement learning. \n","\n","Enter TensorTrade. The idea was to create a highly modular framework for building efficient reinforcement learning trading strategies in a composable, maintainable way. Sounds like a mouthful of buzz-words if you ask me, so let's get into the meat."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"# Overview\n\n![Logo](img/logo.jpeg)\n\nTensorTrade is an open source Python framework for training, evaluating, and deploying robust trading strategies using deep reinforcement learning. The framework focuses on being highly composable and extensible, to allow the system to scale from simple trading strategies on a single CPU, to complex investment strategies run on a distribution of HPC machines.\n\nUnder the hood, the framework uses many of the APIs from existing machine learning libraries to maintain high quality data pipelines and learning models. One of the main goals of TensorTrade is to enable fast experimentation with algorithmic trading strategies, by leveraging the existing tools and pipelines provided by `numpy`, `pandas`, `gym`, `keras`, and `tensorflow`.\n\nThe aim is to simplify the process of testing and deploying robust trading agents using deep reinforcement learning, to allow you and I to focus on creating profitable strategies.\n\n## RL Primer\n\nIn case your reinforcement learning chops are a bit rusty, let's quickly go over the basic concepts.\n\nEvery reinforcement learning problem starts out with an environment and one or more agents that can interact with the environment.\n\n![Primer](img/primer.jpg)\n\n_This technique is based off Markov Decision Processes (MDP) dating back to the 1950s._\n\nThe agent will first observe the environment, then build a model of the current state and the expected value of actions within that environment. Based on that model, the agent will then take the action it has deemed as having the highest expected value.\n\nBased on the effects of the chosen action within the environment, the agent will be rewarded by an amount corresponding to the actual value of that action. The reinforcement learning agent can then, through the process of trial and error (i.e. learning through reinforcement), improve its underlying model and learn to take more rewarding actions over time.\n\nIf you still need a bit of refreshment on the subject, there is a link to an article titled _Introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning_ in the references for this article, which goes much more in-depth into the details. Let's move on.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe following tutorial should provide enough examples to get you started with creating simple trading strategies using TensorTrade, although you will quickly see the framework is capable of handling much more complex configurations.\n\n## Installation\n\nTensorTrade requires Python 3.6 or later, so make sure you're using a valid version before pip installing the framework. "},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Requirement already satisfied: tensortrade in /Users/adam/Desktop/Hedger/tensortrade (0.0.1a5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy==1.17.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from tensortrade) (1.17.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pandas==0.25.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from tensortrade) (0.25.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: gym==0.14.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from tensortrade) (0.14.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pytz>=2017.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from pandas==0.25.0->tensortrade) (2019.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: python-dateutil>=2.6.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from pandas==0.25.0->tensortrade) (2.8.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: scipy in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from gym==0.14.0->tensortrade) (1.3.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: cloudpickle~=1.2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from gym==0.14.0->tensortrade) (1.2.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: six in /Users/adam/Library/Python/3.7/lib/python/site-packages (from gym==0.14.0->tensortrade) (1.12.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pyglet<=1.3.2,>=1.2.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from gym==0.14.0->tensortrade) (1.3.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: future in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from pyglet<=1.3.2,>=1.2.0->gym==0.14.0->tensortrade) (0.17.1)\n"]}],"source":"!pip3 install tensortrade"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["To follow this entire tutorial, you will need to install some extra dependencies, such as `tensorflow`, `stable-baselines`, `tensorforce`, `ccxt`, and `stochastic`."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Collecting tensortrade[ccxt,fbm,tensorforce,tf]\n","\u001b[?25l  Downloading https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/8a/a0/03582b12da736ca55fb1b3b74533905964997848d05a68039fd1053e0db0/tensortrade-0.0.1a13-py3-none-any.whl (53kB)\n","\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 61kB 421kB/s eta 0:00:01\n","\u001b[?25hRequirement already satisfied: numpy==1.17.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from tensortrade[ccxt,fbm,tensorforce,tf]) (1.17.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: gym==0.14.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from tensortrade[ccxt,fbm,tensorforce,tf]) (0.14.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pandas==0.25.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from tensortrade[ccxt,fbm,tensorforce,tf]) (0.25.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: ccxt==1.18.1220;

the environment into meaningful features for an agent to learn from.

For example, if we were using a discrete action space of 3 actions (0 = `hold`, 1 = `buy 100%`, 2 = `sell 100%`), our learning agent does not need to know that returning an action of 1 is equivalent to buying an instrument. Rather, our agent needs to know the reward for returning an action of 1 in specific circumstances, and can leave the implementation details of converting actions to trades to the `ActionStrategy`.\n","\n","Each action strategy has a get_trade method, which will transform the agent's specified action into an executable `Trade`.
